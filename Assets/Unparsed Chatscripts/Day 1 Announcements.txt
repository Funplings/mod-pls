Jr_lover<3: Hey nice job on your first day kid!
Jr_lover<3: Anyways our server is getting bigger so we’ve made a new channel 
Jr_lover<3: It’s called #gamers and its for the people in the most oppressed group in our modern society
Jr_lover<3: In the #gamers channel we have another rule: you must talk in L33t sp3@k (all e’s must be replaced with 3’s and all a’s must be replaced with @’s)
Jr_lover<3: If you see anyone typing normally, delete their message
Jr_lover<3: We’ve also added a rule that every message much start with a capital letter
Jr_lover<3: Because people really need to learn how to type properly
Jr_lover<3: Alright thats it! Type “yes” to get started
