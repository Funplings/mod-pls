Jr_lover<3: So
Jr_lover<3: People have been circumventing our potato rule and that’s not ok
Jr_lover<3: So now we’ve banned the word “fries” as well
Jr_Lover<3: Also by popular request we’ve added an #irl channel and a #server-requests channel
Jr_Lover<3: In #irl links are banned. Delete any messages that contain links (In the format www.something.con)
Jr_Lover<3: And in #server-requests you have to include “please” in every message
Jr_Lover<3: Ok! Type “yes” to get started
