Iyyo: Hey guys, just watched season 1. Got a few questions


vroomster99: holy crap you watched it all in one day??


TinkerTonker: he prolly got no life


sinamin_: what questions do u have iyyo?


Iyyo: Who’s Orphanzo?


vroomster99: …what


sinamin_: he’s the main character


Iyyo: Oh the guy with the white hair


Iyyo: Ok got it. So he controls the four spices right


Iyyo: Salt, pepper, cinnamon, and garlic powder


zosnatz: Perfect seasoning to go on meatballs by the way!


zosnats: Or potatoes


Jr_lover<3: I love garlic powder seasoned potatoes


Iyyo: But what about the other spices

Boss_bae: what do you mean


Iyyo: Like cumin or something


TinkerTonker: is this guy srs


Sinamin_: well i don’t to spoil anything but if uve been paying attention it’s implied that there are other groups centered around other spices


Sinamin_: like klompo and klompo jr were manipulating paprika in that prison break episode


Sinamin_: which makes sense bc at the end of the episode its revealed that they were originally potatoes grown on a potato farm in what was once detroit, michigan


Sinamin_: oops i mean p-words


Iyyo: Oh ok. Got it thanks


Iyyo: SO they’re potatoes… I wonder if that’s important when I fight them in the game
