[Hour 13]

Defender_of_boo: HOLY SHIT
Defender_of_boo: What the hell just happened!!!


sinamin_: Oh are u talking about the finale?
sinamin_: Just so u know we made a channel for that to avoid spoilers in the general chat


Defender_of_boo: Oh ok
Defender_of_boo: Thanks!


Iyyo: I did it! 

TinkerTonker: What, got laid


sinamin_: Hey man not cool
sinamin_: What happened, iyyo


Iyyo: I finally beat Klompo Jr


sinamin_: OH
sinamin_: Nice!!!
sinamin_: How’d you do it??


Iyyo: Well like I said yesterday I was stuck on his potato shield skin phase
Iyyo: But then I tried going for his eye
Iyyo: The hitbox is really small so I had to grind a bunch to level up my dexterity first so I could have enough accuracy to hit it
Iyyo: but eventually I built up enough dex and I hit his eye
Iyyo: And I took him out


sinamin_: Yooo, good job
sinamin_: That’s a hard boss fight for sure


TinkerTonker: What are you talking about lol that fight’s easy as shit
TinkerTonker: This guy’s such a noob


Iyyo: Well I’m not the best gamer I admit
Iyyo: But I feel pretty proud of myself for this one!
Iyyo: Shoot I used an exclamation point again
Iyyo: These rules are getting really harsh


TinkerTonker: YEAH tell me about it
TinkerTonker: These mods are such bitches man
TinkerTonker: First this capitalization shit
TinkerTonker: Now we can’t use exclamation points??


Iyyo: It is a bit much
Iyyo: My father was a strict man
Iyyo: Whenever I broke any of his rules he made me stand in the corner for twenty minutes
Iyyo: Sometimes I appreciate the discipline he instilled in me
Iyyo: But sometimes I resent him for it too 


TinkerTonker: shit man
TinkerTonker: My dad was that way too
TinkerTonker: I still hate that piece of shit for driving my mom away
TinkerTonker: But still he’s my dad you know
TinkerTonker: I think that’s why I like this show so much
TinkerTonker: I feel like it really understands what its like to have such a complicated relationship with your parent
