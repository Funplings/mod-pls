Jr_lover<3: Hello!!!! Congrats on being a mod


Jr_lover<3: If its your first time its easy.


Jr_lover<3: rn there is only one rule: you can’t say potato (don’t ask why it’s a sensitive subject)


Jr_lover<3: if someone breaks the rule, click on their message to flag it for deletion


Jr_lover<3: If you accidentally delete a message that doesn’t break a rule, or if you let a rule-breaking message reach the top of the screen without deleting it, ull get a strike


Jr_lover<3: If you get three strikes, unfortunately we will have to remove ur modding privileges :(


Jr_lover<3: thats it!!! If you’re ready to start type “yes” in this channel
