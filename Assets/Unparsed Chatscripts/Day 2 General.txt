[Hour 13]

Iyyo: Wow, season 2 was a doozy.


zosnatz: Tell me about it!


TinkerTonker: lol why am i not surprised


boss_bae: What did you think of the scene where we find out the klompos are cloned potatoes??


boss_bae: Sorry spoilers for season 2


boss_bae: although honestly u probably shouldnt even be on this server if ur not at least caught up to season 2 yet lol


Iyyo: Wait, they’re clones?


Iyyo: And they’re potatoes?


TinkerTonker: LMAO is does this guy even has his eyes open when hes watching


Jr_lover<3: I know right


sinamin_: yeah they’re pre-fried fries (fun loophole i saw the other day)


sinamin_: :)

[Hour 16]
[Hour 17.5]

sinamin_: Parenti has a farm where he grows klompos for his army 


sinamin_: Most of them grow up to be loyal servants in parenti’s army, but klompo jr was picked from the ground early and started questioning parenti’s reign


sinamin_: that’s how he got his eyepatch, one day he defied parenti’s orders and parenti ordered klompo to dig out klompo jr’s eye


TinkerTonker: Yeah that shit was disgusting


Iyyo: I see, very interesting


Iyyo: Seems like this might help in my ongoing attempts to defeat Klompo Jr in the game

[Hour 20]
[Hour 21]

Iyyo: I’m kicking him in the shins like you guys suggested but I just can’t get past the final phase


Iyyo: I can’t do any damage to him when his potato skin shield is up 


Iyyo: But maybe his eye is his weak spot

[Hour 22]

stanzos: I think you might be able to beat him if you had a fedora!


zosnatz: I agree!


parentididnothingwrong: Personally i think klompo jr deserved it


parentididnothingwrong: It wasn’t his place to question parenti


parentididnothingwrong: Honestly he should’ve had both eyes taken out


vroomster99: what’s wrong with u man


parentididnothingwrong: idaho is a fucked up place man


parentididnothingwrong: It’s kill or be killed in that potato wasteland


parentididnothingwrong: No room for weakness


sinamin_: Well that’s an interesting perspective pdnw :/


boss_bae: Ignore him he’s always doing this shit


boss_bae: after parenti wiped out the Paprika village this guy was on here the next morning talking about how efficient his methods were


boss_bae: Honestly think he’s got some of like fetish for him or something


sinamin_: We all have our quirks


Jr_lover<3: some more than others lol

[Hour 2.3]
[Hour 3.5]

parentididnothingwrong: Trust me my admiration for parenti is purely platonic


parentididnothingwrong: I love my wife


TinkerTonker: So do i


TinkerTonker: U know what im sayin
