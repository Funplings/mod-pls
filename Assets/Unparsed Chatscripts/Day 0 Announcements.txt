[Hour 24]


Jr_lover<3: Hello!!!! Congrats on being a mod
Jr_lover<3: If it’s your first time it’s easy
Jr_lover<3: Rn there is only one rule: you can’t say potato (don’t ask why it’s a sensitive subject)
Jr_lover<3: If someone breaks the rule, click on their message to delete it
Jr_lover<3: Make sure to enforce the rules properly! At the end of the day we’ll figure out how many violating messages you missed and how many you erroneously deleted
Jr_lover<3: If you make too many mistakes, unfortunately we will have to remove ur modding privileges :(
Jr_lover<3: That's it!!! If you’re ready to start type “yes” in this channel
